Because HubPress is hosted on GitHub, you can update by pulling down the latest changes from the HubPress master repository.

If you're new to GitHub, the repository you forked the project from is referred to as `Upstream`.

With the btn:[Check for Update] button, you can update to the latest version.

.How To Update Your HubPress Instance to the Latest Version
. Click menu:Settings[Check for Upgrade].
. Review the changes between your repository (left) and the HubPress upstream (right).
You should only see changes made by the HubPress team, and not edits you have made to posts.
