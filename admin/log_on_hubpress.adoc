Enter your GitHub username and password to log into HubPress Admin.

HubPress creates a personal token, which it uses for requests to the GitHub API.

NOTE: The token synchronises across all sessions of HubPress. 
If you open the Administration Console on your PC and then your Tablet, the token applies to all devices.
