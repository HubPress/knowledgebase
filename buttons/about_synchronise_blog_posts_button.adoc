The btn:[Synchronize] button allows you to re-synchronise your posts between HubPress browser sessions.

This is useful when you may have authored a post on your HubPress tablet, and you can't see the blog post on your HubPress PC.

It can also help when the local database used by HubPress gets out-of-sync across browsers.
