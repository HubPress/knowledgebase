The *Google Analytics* field takes the Google Analytics Tracking ID of your site. 

For example `UA-1234567-1`.

If you do not have a Google Analytics tracking ID, you can set one up easily on the website, or through the Google Analytics app on android and iOS.

You can use Google Analytics to track where your readers are coming from.
