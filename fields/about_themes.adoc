You select the *Theme* from the list of themes stored in the `/themes` directory.

This field is a free-text field, but you need to specify the theme according to the folder name.

The current folder names are:

* casper
* ghostium
* ichi
* roon
* saga
* uno
* uno-zen

.New in 0.5.1
NOTE: Theme names are lowercase for consistency.
If you find your theme is not loading, check the Site settings and adjust the names accordingly.
