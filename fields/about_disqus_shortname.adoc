The *Disqus shortname* field takes your Disqus user name that you specified when registering a new site for Disqus.

Only the shortname is required, not a link to your profile page.

If you have not enabled Disqus for your site, create a site profile at https://disqus.com/admin/create/ with the name of your blog to get started.
