The *Pinterest* field lets you share your Pins with your readers.

For example: `https://au.pinterest.com/kami76/`

This link is an example of an Australian profile.
Visit your profile and check the link in your profile page for your regional vanity URL.

The field does not confirm the URL. 
Test the URL once your settings update on your live site.
