The *LinkedIn* field lets you share your LinkedIn profile so readers can _add you to their LinkedIn network_. 

A valid example of this URL is: https://au.linkedin.com/in/janesmith

This link is an example of an Australian profile. 
Visit your profile and check the link in your profile page for your regional LinkedIn vanity URL.

The field does not confirm the validity of the URL. 
Test the URL once your settings update on your live site.
