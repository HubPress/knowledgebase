The *Logo* and *Cover Image* fields allow you to specify art assets to use on each page of your blog:

* An HTML link to an image hosting service. For example gravatar, for your avatar.
* A link to an image committed to the `/images` directory of your blog repository.

IMPORTANT: The format you specify in these fields is important for repository-hosted images.

You must use the pattern `/images/<filename>` so the static site generator can create the image paths to each sub-page of your blog.

Failing to specify the leading forward-slash will mean the absolute path generated in the HTML pages will break.
You'll know this has happened when Page 2 of your blog onwards does not have any cover or logo images.
