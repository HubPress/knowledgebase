In most cases, the issue you're experiencing with publishing will be markup related.
Sometimes publishing issues you encounter after just setting up 

To correct issues, switch to preview mode and see if things like headings are showing as you would expect.

Sometimes the Asciidoctor engine will enforce correctly-nested structure and prevent the post from publishing. 

Check your first level heading in your blog post if you can't click the save icon.

If that is not working, make sure you have set your default branch correctly in GitHub. 
See the README in your forked HubPress repository for initial configuration instructions. 

Make sure you *re-read* the instructions again to ensure you have correctly selected `master` or `gh-pages` depending on your GitHub Pages configuration.
