You can use Git command line or a Git app to add images to your blog posts:

. Commit images to the `/images` directory.
. In your blog post, use the following basic AsciiDoc syntax:
+
```
image::hubpress.jpg[]
```

. See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoctor Writer's Guide] for complete `image` syntax. 

You can do a lot with images, including adjusting the size of the image, the caption, the alt text, and other settings.
