You can edit your posts in a local copy of your HubPress repository, however you will need to log onto HubPress Admin to publish your post.

There is no command-line or API for HubPress that would allow you to avoid the interface.

If you want a near WYSIWYG interface to edit your AsciiDoc files, applications like http://atom.io[Atom Editor] or http://asciidocfx.com[AsciidocFX Editor] are excellent choices.
