HubPress uses the Asciidoctor `Article` container to structure posts.

The blog title is always Level 1 in an AsciiDoc post. For example, `= Title` sets the name of the Blog Post to `Title` when published.

IMPORTANT: The Level 1 heading is mandatory for the blog post to save.

The editor has basic validation built-in.
If you don't start your blog with a Level 1 heading, there are no Preview or Save buttons in the editor. 
This is a visual clue to check your blog structure.

If you want a first-level (chapter) heading you use `== First Level Heading`, and so on to create other nested headings.

For sections, use a `=== Second Level Heading` to create subsections below your chapters.
