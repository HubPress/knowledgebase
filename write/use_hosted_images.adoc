To embed images from a hosted source, put the full URL to the image in place of the `full_path_to_image`. 

.Hosted Image Embed  
  image::http://full_path_to_image[]

NOTE: See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoctor Writer's Guide] for complete `image` syntax. 

You can do a lot with images, including adjusting the size of the image, the caption, the alt text, and other settings.

Hosted sources include (but are not limited to): 

* Instagram. 
* another GitHub repository. 
* any photo hosting site.
