Developers use the GitHub Gist service to store and share code snippets with other developers.

You can use the gist macro to integrate Gist snippets from any developer in your posts.

The `gist` macro works similarly to the YouTube and Vimeo macros.

For example with the gist https://gist.github.com/anthonny/7786310 the usage is described in the following code samples.

.Include an entire Gist
[source,asciidoc]
----
gist::7786310[]
----

.Include a Gist Featuring a Line Range
[source,asciidoc]
----
gist::7786310[lines:16..20]
----

.Include a Gist Featuring a Line Range and Language
