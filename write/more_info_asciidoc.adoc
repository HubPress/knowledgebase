If you are new to AsciiDoc, you may need some help working out how to do things you're used to in Markdown, or perhaps for the first time.

Help is at hand!

Visit http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/ for a comprehensive and canonical resource for writing in AsciiDoc using the Asciidoctor toolchain. 

From this resource, you can learn more about:

* bulleted and numbered lists
* links
* tables
* code sample block
* images and figures

The control over content and presentation you have with AsciiDoc will surprise you, when compared to Markdown.

Don't be tempted to use the guide located at http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/. This guide refers to the Python version of AsciiDoc which is not what HubPress uses.
