Use the same HubPress instance with multiple authors by adding contributors to the repo in which HubPress is hosted.

Attribution::  
  The first person to create a blog post is credited as the writer. 
  Edits by other contributors are attributed to the first person who created the post.
Site Changes:: 
  Changes to general settings _do not_ affect the author data attributed to each post.

.How To Add Collaborators to your HubPress Repository
. Open your HubPress site on GitHub.
. Click menu:Settings[Collaborators].
. Add the GitHub users for which you want to grant access to your blog.

When you add contributors, they are notified by the GitHub notification system. 
Once they accept the invitation, they can collaborate with you on content development for the blog.
