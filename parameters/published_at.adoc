By default, the publication date is the date you created the Blog Post. 

You can force the publication date by adding the `:published_at:` parameter.

.:published_at: Example
[source, asciidoc]
----
= Blog Title
:published_at: 2019-01-31
----

Setting this parameter as specified will set the publish date to 31st January, 2019.
This has the effect of "pinning" the post to the top of the post list.
