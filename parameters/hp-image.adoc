If you have a theme to your blog, this allows your readers to get a visual clue about the contents of the post.

If you want to add a cover image to your Blog Post, set the `hp-image` attribute.

.:hp-image: Example
[source, asciidoc]
----
= Blog Title
:hp-image: /images/a-cover-image.jpg
----

NOTE: HubPress does not set the `/images` directory path as the default for cover images: you must declare the full path to the image.

Consider creating a `/covers` directory in your repository to group the cover images together.

Naming the cover images consistently will make it easy to apply to every post. 

.:hp-image: with `/covers` directory specified
[source, asciidoc]
----
= Blog Title
:hp-image: /images/covers/a-cover-image.jpg
----

The `Saga` theme supports cover images.
