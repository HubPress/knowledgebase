If code samples contain delimited asterix symbols, this pattern is parsed as processing instructions by Asciidoctor.

Specify `:compat-mode: true` to disable processing in code blocks.

.:compat-mode: Example
[source, asciidoc]
----
= Blog Title
:compat mode: true
    `egrep '\(\ *\)\ *\{' /var/log/nginx/*`
----

If `:compat-mode:` was not specified here, the code sample would render like this:

    egrep '\(\ \)\ *\{' /var/log/nginx/

See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/migration/#compat-mode[AsciiDoctor Migration Guide] for more information about `:compat-mode:`.
