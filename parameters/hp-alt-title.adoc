If you write blog posts in a language other than English, you must specify an alternative title using the `:hp-alt-title:` parameter.

The alternative title is used when your post is published.

.:hp-alt-title: Example
[source, asciidoc]
----
= 大千世界
:hp-alt-title: My English Title
----

The reason for this is because HubPress uses a library to convert the blog title to a URL (known as "Slugifying" the URL). 

This library currently does not support Glyph characters found in Chinese or Japanese languages.
