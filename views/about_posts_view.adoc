The *Posts* view is the default view you see when you first log onto HubPress.

When you first start HubPress, the *Posts* view is empty.

As you create blog posts, the page populates with the list of posts on the left, and a rendered preview of the blog post itself on the right.

HubPress takes advantage of your screen size and adapts the view to optimise the number of posts displayed.
