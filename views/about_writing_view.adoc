The Writing view is where you author blog posts. You write posts in AsciiDoc mark-up language.

You can change the theme using the btn:[Editor Theme] button.

The view defaults to text only. You can change this to a split live preview using the btn:[Live Preview] button. 

Use the btn:[Save] button to save your post while you write.

Use the btn:[Publish] button to push your blog post to your static HubPress blog site.
