HubPress uses the Ghost themes to control the look and feel of blogs.

You can use almost any Ghost theme available, providing you know how HubPress maps the theme assets. 

If you look into the theme folders, you'll see a mapping file. 
You map the Ghost theme assets back into a mapping file. 
HubPress knows what parts of a theme to load, which allows HubPress to consume your theme.

NOTE: The way themes are offered will change from 0.7.1.
If you want to contribute a theme, create a request in the HubPress Bug Tracker and we'll help you.
